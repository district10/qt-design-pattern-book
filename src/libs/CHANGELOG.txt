Release 2.0 - 2011-04-04

   MetaData library no longer depends on phonon.
   sqlmetadata does not depend on anything but metadata, and finds the correct metadataloader instance at runtime using the Abstract::MetaData interface.
   The project files can be modified to switch between implementations of metadataloader at build-time
   without code changes. 

Release 1.1 - 2009-12-03

   Overall, small changes in all libs to properly export the classes
   in DLLs, for both both MSVC and MingW.

   In dataobjects, I removed PropsMap, because QObject now supports
   dynamic properties. Furthermore, DataObjectFactory is renamed to
   QObjectFactory, newObject() returns QObject* instead of DataObject*, and
   makes use of the new Qt 4.5 QMetaObject::newInstance() function and
   Q_INVOKABLE macro.

   There were a number of bugs I found and fixed in DataObjectTableModel
   as I was using it in more ways from other programs.

   The "metadata" library meant to replace "filetagger" and "mp3file" libraries.
   It uses Phonon instead of id3lib. This means it has read-only access to
   id3 tags.

   Constraints are gone. We use QSortFilterProxy + model-view classes
   instead. Constraints were written back in the Qt3 days before any
   of the Model-View framework was available.

   The "forms" library is obsolete and the material in the book that
   references it is rewritten to use designer and QFormLayout instead.

   xmlsupport.h/cpp are removed. We use Qt::escape to escape xml now.
