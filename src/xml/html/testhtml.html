<head> <title> This is a title </title>

 <!--Unterminated <link> and <input> tags are commonplace
         in HTML code:    -->
 <link rel="Saved&nbsp;Searches" title="oopdocbook"
   href="buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&amp;namedcmd=oopdocbook">
 <link rel="Saved&nbsp;Searches" title="queryj"
   href="buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&amp;namedcmd=queryj">
</head>
<body>
<p> This is a paragraph. What do you think of that?

Html makes use of unterminated line-breaks: <br>
And those do not make XML parsers happy. <br>

<ul>
<li> HTML is not very strict. 
<li> An unclosed tag doesn't bother HTML parsers one bit.
</ul>
